## Intro
This is an attempt at a bank app UI clone made using React-native and has almost all features you would expect from an app made for a bank.


## Features
It has a Scrollview that shows each of your stocks and their values.
<br />


You will be greeted with the image shown above as you enter


Clicking on the '?' icon randomly increases or decreases your account balance while triggering the Activity Indicator on the top.
<span>
<p align='center'>

<img src='../assets/Increase.png' width=259 height=518.33>
<img src='../assets/activityIndicator.png' width=259 height=518.33>
</p>
</span>



<br />
<br />

By default your balance will be present as USD to convert it into rupees simply click on the â‚¹ icon and on the $ icon to revert it back.

</p>

Tapping on any of the stocks present in the scrollview shows up a popup(or modal) prompting a 'BUY' or 'SELL' option.

</p>


Clicking on the left hand side of the scrollbar ie., on the user icon, the options pop-up is shown.

</p>

And Clicking on the Bell icon shows your notifications (there arent any at the moment).

That wraps up everything the App can do for now.
